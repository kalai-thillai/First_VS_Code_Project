    <p>The Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy around 13.6 billion years old with large pivoting arms stretching out across the cosmos. Its disk is about 100,000 light-years and just 1000 light-years thick, according to Las Cumbres Observatory. 

        Just as Earth orbits the sun, the solar system orbits the center of the Milky Way. Despite hurtling through space at speeds of around 515,000mph (828,000kmph) it still takes our solar system approximately 250 million years to complete a single revolution, according to Interesting Engineering. The last time our planet was in this position, dinosaurs were just emerging and mammals were yet to evolve. 
        
        If the center of the Milky Way were a city, we would be living in suburbia, about 25,000 to 30,000 light-years from the city center. Life in the outskirts is good, we find ourselves nestled in one of the smaller neighborhoods, the Orion-Cygnus Arm, sandwiched between larger Perseus and Carina-Sagittarius arms. If we were to travel inwards towards the city center we would find the Scutum-Centaurus and Norma arms. </p>
